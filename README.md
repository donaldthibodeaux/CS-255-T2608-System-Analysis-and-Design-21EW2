# CS-255-T2608-System-Analysis-and-Design-21EW2
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The owner of Driverpass wanted a website to help driving students prepare for the driving test. They would be able to see updated material from the DMV and also schedule driving lessons and take pratice test. I think on this presentation I did a good job of explaining the system requirements of the site.The one part I would revise would be some of the businness requirements to include more information on what would be needed. I believe i did include everything the user would need to navagate the site. It is important to think of the user when thinking about system design, it is important to think of the end user and what they would need or think when navagating the system. For me the most important part is siting down with the client and gather as much information as possible. During the meeting it is important to ask the client detailed questions, you want to be able to understand the clients vision.
